        // 1. The didSet observer attached to the gameWon property is a Swift particularity called Property Observer. With that you can observe changes in the value of a property and react accordingly. There are two property observers: willSet is called just before a property value change occurs, whereas didSet occurs just after.

    // Note: Property Observers have a parameter that allows you to check the new value of the property (in willSet) or its old value (in didSet) allowing value changes comparison right when it occurs. These parameters have default names if you do not provide your own, respectively newValue and oldValue.
